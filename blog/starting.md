# Current Goals
- Focus on: How do we make the best performing agent?

    - Thinking about what metrics I'm using to measure best

- [ou_max_player.py](poke-env/examples/ou_max_player.py)
    - make a team and manage team preview (?: select your pokemon team order + see their pokemon)

# TODOs
- Evaluate a mixed bag of agents against eachother
    - ~~random, max-damage~~, SimpleHeuristicsPlayer
    - look at the metrics, try to think of 5 other metrics to keep track of
        - look at games for interesting proxies
    - make my own agent and evaluate it against the others
- start looking into MCTS / minmax w/ alpha-beta pruning approach (model based planning)
- consider: start with small pool of pokemon
    - specify gen 1?
- Look into the [showdown bots](http://sahovic.fr/pokemon-ai-resources/)

# My strategy ideas
- Switching MaxDamage
    - MaxDamage agent, but if I can switch to a better pokemon to kill you, I do it

# Agent specification
def Class(Player):
- def choose_move(self, battle)
    - select action in battle
- def teampreview(self, battle)
    - select initial team order
