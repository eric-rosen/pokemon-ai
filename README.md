# Pokemon AI
Exploring AI for pokemon via the amazing [poke-env](https://github.com/hsahovic/poke-env) repo.

# Getting started
You can import this library via:
`import pokemon_ai`

# How this repo is laid out
- `blog` keeps track of my thoughts
- `pokemon_ai` the *good stuff*
    - `agents` are actual agents that can be ran
    - `eval` is code for testing `agents` against other `agents`
    - `metrics` heuristics for evaluating states, pokemon, etc.
